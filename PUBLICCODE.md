# Standard for Public Code
We want our project to be well-structured, and we want to be able to explain why it is.
In order to develop the best project we possibly can and to meet our requirements, we adhere to the standard of public code:

[Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net)

## Criteria
To meet the criteria of the standard of public code, we compare our criteria to those of the public code standard.

### Code in the open

### Welcome contributors

### Make contributing easy
To make contributing as easy as possible we created an [example github repository](https://github.com/ConductionNL/commonground-example), that anyone can use to create their own commonground component just like this one. We also have a [dashboard application](https://commonground.conduction.nl/) that anyone can use to deploy their own created components or the ones created by other organizations/people.

### Maintain version control

### Require review of contributions

### Document your objectives

### Use plain English
During development we always write our documentation in English and we make sure to create file and class names in american english.

### Use open standards
We use a number of standards as mandatory, see the readme for these standards we use.

### Use continuous integration
To quickly identify problems and reduce risks during development we make use of github workflow and include automated tests such as StyleCI, Better Code Hub and a Postman Collection.

### Publish with an open license
publiceren alles onder eupld

### Use a coherent style
To adhere a coding and writing style we use the already existing [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/). We are using StyleCi for automated test on our coding style.

### Document codebase maturity
